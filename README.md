# React + TypeScript + Vite Clone Translate Application

This project is a Full Stack Application, utilizing TypeScript, React and Vite. It features sophisticated implementations of useReducer and useDebounce, enhancing the efficiency of user status management and interactions. This project encompasses both the frontend and backend, as I have designed the server side using Node.js and integrated a third-party service, OpenAI's GPT-3.5-turbo model.

As a person who loves learning new languages, I've dedicated my time to create a great application that helps me with that! Yeap!! It's a clone of Google Translate built using TypeScript, React, and Vite.üòç
